# Changelog — Comic Book Art Creator

## v1.24.0 — 2026-08-12
- **Face swap is now a checkbox, not a button.** 🔀 **Use RAG & LoRA for
  image swap** (in the image-editor section) replaces the "Swap into
  selected" button. Tick it and Generate runs two steps: your prompt +
  preset + LoRAs + RAG map draw the styled picture as usual, then the
  face from your loaded image (or the chosen 👤 Person if nothing is
  loaded) is applied to the person in it. Both pictures land in the
  gallery — the styled base and the face-swapped one. While ticked, a
  loaded image is the face, not an edit target; untick to go back to
  normal instruction editing. Variations = N base+swap pairs. The
  setting is remembered across restarts.
- **The face actually lands now: the swap runs on Qwen Image Edit** when
  it's installed (it self-installs on first use like any editor; needs
  ~24 GB VRAM). Qwen takes multiple images natively, and in live testing
  it transferred the face correctly on every pair — including ones where
  Flux Kontext kept the scene but ignored the face entirely. Without
  Qwen the swap falls back to Kontext, which preserves the scene but may
  need a few Variations for the identity to land.
- **Security hardening + delta review.** The LoRA trigger reader now
  refuses oversized sidecar files (>5 MB) and caps any trigger phrase at
  200 characters before it can reach the prompt. A full OWASP delta
  review of everything added since v1.20 is appended to `SECURITY.md` —
  verdict: no new attack surface; all new file parsing is bounded.

## v1.23.0 — 2026-08-12
- **Stronger face transfer.** The swap instruction now explicitly demands
  the head and face be replaced with the second image's person — facial
  structure, eyes, skin tone, hair, beard — and the swap runs at higher
  guidance (3.0) so Kontext follows the instruction instead of just
  restyling the base picture. If a swap still comes back with the original
  face, try Variations 3–5 and keep the best — identity transfer varies
  by seed.
- **Canvas size is respected everywhere in a swap.** The swapped picture
  now always lands at your Canvas size in gen-then-swap (previously a
  4x-upscaled base dragged the swap to 4x size), and a direct swap always
  keeps the selected picture's exact size (previously Kontext snapped to
  its own ~1-megapixel dimensions unless "Output at Canvas size" was
  ticked).

## v1.22.0 — 2026-08-12
- **Face swap actually swaps now.** The Kontext swap was sending the two
  pictures stitched side-by-side, and the model redrew them side-by-side
  (or ignored the face) instead of transferring it. Both swap paths now
  feed the base picture and the face as two separate chained references,
  and the face really lands on the person — verified live against the old
  behavior on the same seed.
- **Variations applies to swaps.** Set Variations to N and 🔀 makes N
  complete base+swap sets (nothing selected) or N differently-seeded swap
  attempts on the selected picture — keep the best. The direct swap also
  honors your Random/fixed seed choice now.
- **The 🔀 Swap button is red and bigger**, so the one-click action stands
  out from the row of utility buttons around it.

## v1.21.0 — 2026-08-12
- **Generate + swap in one click.** 🔀 no longer needs a picture selected in
  the gallery: with nothing selected it first generates a base image from
  your prompt + preset + LoRAs + RAG map, then swaps the chosen face into it
  with Flux Kontext — and keeps both pictures. With a gallery picture
  selected it still swaps straight into that one. Your styling applies to
  the base generation; the swap pass only changes the person.
- **LoRA trigger words are applied automatically.** When you tick a LoRA,
  its activation keyword(s) are read from the LoRA's own metadata (kohya /
  `modelspec`) or a CivitAI sidecar file next to it, and quietly added to
  the prompt sent to the engine — you never have to remember or type them.
  Already-present words aren't doubled, and your typed prompt is untouched.
  The CivitAI downloader now saves the trained words beside every LoRA it
  fetches, and ➕ Add LoRA file… carries an existing sidecar along.
- **Hover tooltips everywhere.** The whole left panel (prompt, negative,
  model, presets, LoRAs, RAG map, canvas, steps, variations, seed), the
  animator, and the gallery/save buttons now explain themselves on hover,
  matching the editor tooltips added in v1.20.0.

## v1.20.0 — 2026-08-12
- **LoRA / RAG status badges, top-right.** Two badges next to the GPU meter
  show at a glance whether LoRAs and your RAG map will affect the next
  generation: **green = will apply**, **red = won't**. LoRA is green when at
  least one is ticked and you're not editing a loaded image; RAG is green
  when a valid map is loaded, you're not editing, and the model is SDXL (RAG
  image guidance needs SDXL, so it's red on Flux). Loading an editor image
  turns both red; clearing it turns them back green.
- **Swap into selected now takes a loaded image as the face too** — not just
  the Reference DB person. When both are available it asks which to use. The
  loaded image is consumed by the swap and cleared afterwards, so LoRAs and
  RAG switch back on for your next generation. It no longer requires a DB at
  all — load a face and swap it into any selected picture.
- **Hover tooltips** explain every image-editor control (Load, Use selected,
  Reference DB, Person, To editor, Swap, editor engine, canvas size, and the
  new badges). The wordy image-editor heading is now a brief line, with the
  detail moved into the tooltips.
- The three primary **Generate buttons** (art, animation, border) are now the
  same size.

## v1.19.0 — 2026-08-12
- **LoRA + RAG + a person now combine in one generation.** When an
  embeddings-only ("private") RAG map and a Reference DB person are both
  active, they no longer fight — the map's guidance and the person's face
  chain on a single IP-Adapter, so your LoRAs and RAG map build the styled
  body and scene while the person steers the identity, all in one pass.
  (Previously the chosen person replaced the private map for that run.)
  Image-based RAG maps already combined with a person and still do; SDXL
  models only, as before.
- **🔀 Swap into selected — one-click person swap.** A new button by the
  Reference DB sends the selected picture plus the chosen person straight to
  Flux Kontext with a ready-made "replace the person, keep the pose, framing,
  costume, lighting and art style" instruction. It turns the two-step
  "build a styled body, then swap the face in" flow into a single click, and
  keeps the output at the source picture's size. The button is enabled once
  you have a generated or selected image and a person chosen.
- The ℹ what-uses-what help now documents both: how LoRAs, RAG and a person
  combine in plain generation, and the new one-click swap.

## v1.18.0 — 2026-08-11
- **Reference database.** A new part of the Image editor section loads a
  people database made with the separate Actor DB Builder tool (a portable
  SQLite file built by the user from IMDb lists: name, age, sex and a
  photo per person — nothing ships with the app). 📇 Reference DB… loads
  the file; 👤 Person… opens a picker — searchable, every column sortable
  ascending/descending by clicking its header, with a photo preview — and
  the chosen person shows as a small thumbnail. The photo is extra context
  for the model, applied to whatever you're doing:
  - *Editing* (editor images loaded): the photo joins the editor's
    reference images exactly as if it had been loaded with 🖼 Load…, so
    Kontext/Qwen can draw that person into the result. ➡ To editor loads
    the photo as an editor reference directly for person-only edits.
  - *Plain generation* (no editor images): the face guides via IP-Adapter
    with your presets and LoRAs still active (SDXL models only). If an
    embeddings-only RAG map is also active, the explicitly chosen person
    wins for that run and the status bar says so.
  This is not RAG: nothing is retrieved — the selected picture is sent
  straight through. The DB path and chosen person survive restarts.
- **What-uses-what help.** An ℹ button beside the Reference DB explains
  which extras apply in each mode — editing bypasses presets, LoRAs and
  RAG maps (the editor pipeline doesn't use them), plain generation keeps
  them all — and the Image editor header now says so too.

## v1.17.0 — 2026-08-11
- **Remove a LoRA from the list.** A new "🗑 Remove" button next to
  ➕ Add LoRA file… deletes the ticked LoRA(s) from your LoRA folder — the
  list is a view of that folder, so that is what removing means. It asks
  first and says plainly that files are being deleted, warns if you are
  removing the frame LoRA the Border maker uses, and tells you if one
  could not be deleted because the engine still has it open.
- **Remove a RAG map.** The cryptic ✕ beside the RAG map is now a labelled
  "🗑 Remove" that takes the map out of use and forgets it, so it does not
  come back next launch. The map file on disk is left alone.
- **Missing files no longer linger.** LoRAs and RAG maps are re-checked
  whenever the lists refresh. A LoRA deleted or moved outside the app is
  dropped from your ticked selection instead of being sent to the engine
  and failing the job; a RAG map whose file has gone is unloaded with a
  note. If only some of a map's references are missing, the map keeps
  working and the label says how many are gone — "12 imgs (3 missing)".

## v1.16.1 — 2026-08-11
- **Fix: private (embeds) RAG maps now actually generate.** The embed path
  passed the basic IP-Adapter node's `weight_type: "standard"`, but the
  `IPAdapterEmbeds` node is an advanced node whose weight list has no
  "standard" — so the engine rejected the graph (HTTP 400) and no picture was
  made. Now uses "linear" (the advanced-node equivalent). Caught by a live
  end-to-end test in the real engine: with the fix, an embeds map renders an
  image essentially identical to feeding the reference images directly (mean
  pixel difference under 2 on 0–255), confirming the precomputed embeds
  condition IP-Adapter the same way the images would.

## v1.16.0 — 2026-08-11
- **Private RAG references.** A retrieval map made in Laura-Trainer with the
  new "Private references" option carries no viewable pictures — instead it
  ships each reference as a precomputed IP-Adapter embed. The app now reads
  those maps and feeds the embeds through the same "PLUS" IP-Adapter it uses
  for image references, so a map can guide your pictures without ever handing
  over openable copies of the training images. Ordinary image maps work
  exactly as before; the app picks the right path automatically. If a map has
  no usable references at all, it still falls back to using the captions as
  prompt text.
- Under the hood: retrieval, near-duplicate skipping, the paired-LoRA
  auto-apply and the trigger word behave identically for both kinds of map;
  only the final guidance step differs (stock `IPAdapterLoadEmbeds` →
  `IPAdapterCombineEmbeds` → `IPAdapterEmbeds` nodes for the embed path).

## v1.15.0 — 2026-08-11
- **Your setup is remembered properly.** Ticking a LoRA is now saved the
  moment you do it, so the LoRAs you work with are still ticked next
  time. A loaded RAG map and the prompt you last typed come back too.
  (The LoRA list had no way to trigger a save, so the choice only
  survived if some other setting happened to change before you closed.)
- **Blue dividers between the sections** of the left panel, so picture
  making, the image editor, the animator, the border maker and the batch
  queue are told apart at a glance.
- **Cancel now actually cancels.** Pressing ✕ during a Variations run
  stopped the picture being drawn and then quietly started the next one —
  so cancelling a set of six only ever skipped one picture. Measured on a
  set of five: the old Cancel still produced four of them. The button now
  stops the whole run at once: the current picture, the rest of the set,
  and anything waiting in the batch queue. Pictures that had already
  finished are kept, and the status line tells you where it stopped
  ("Cancelled — stopped after 2 of 6").
- Cancel is noticed within about a second instead of only between
  pictures, the engine's own queue is cleared so nothing restarts behind
  your back, and a border's automatic second pass and an animation's
  post-processing both stop as well.

## v1.14.0 — 2026-08-11
- **Add your own base model.** A new "📁 Add model…" button beside the
  model dropdown browses to any `.safetensors` on your disk — one you
  trained yourself, or downloaded from anywhere — and makes it available
  straight away, selected and ready to generate with. No restart needed,
  even if the engine is already running.
  - On the same drive the model is linked in rather than copied, so it
    takes no extra space at all. If it lives on another drive it has to
    be copied, and you're told the size before that starts; the copy runs
    in the background with the progress bar.
  - `.ckpt` and `.pt` files are refused with an explanation. They are
    pickle files and can run code when loaded, which is why this app only
    ever accepts safetensors.

## v1.13.1 — 2026-08-10
- **Closing the app now frees your graphics card.** The engine is a
  separate program that keeps the last model it used loaded — 7 GB after
  an SDXL job, up to ~17 GB after a Flux one. It used to keep running
  after you closed the window, so that memory stayed occupied until you
  rebooted or hunted the process down, and the leftover engine went on
  holding port 8188 against your next launch. Closing the window now
  shuts it down as well, and a leftover engine from a session that
  crashed is cleaned up too. An engine belonging to a second app window
  you still have open is left alone.
- **Fixed the stop-the-engine command, which never worked.** It looked
  for processes whose command line contained "ComfyUI", but the engine is
  started from inside that folder and its command line says only
  "main.py" — so it matched nothing, every time. Anything that needed to
  restart the engine (installing IP-Adapter, applying a model update,
  repairing the model paths at startup) quietly failed to stop the old
  one, then hit "port 8188 already in use" and carried on talking to the
  stale engine. It now matches by this installation's own folder.

## v1.13.0 — 2026-08-10
- **Prompt enhancer (optional, local).** A ✨ Enhance button under the
  prompt expands a few words into a full comic-art prompt using Ollama,
  a free local LLM runner — nothing leaves your machine. ↩ puts your own
  wording back. Ollama is never installed or required by this app: if it
  isn't running, the button explains what it is and everything else works
  exactly as before. Reasoning-model padding, "Sure, here's…" lead-ins and
  stray quoting are stripped from what comes back.
- **Reads the maps a trainer actually writes.** The 🧭 RAG map… button now
  takes a map file, the folder holding one, or a trainer's `index.json` —
  and understands both the flat `.ragmap.json` and the earlier
  `lora-retrieval-map` layout (`images_dir`, `embeddings_file`, entries
  with no keywords, a LoRA named without its extension). See RAGMAP.md.
- **The paired LoRA installs itself.** If the map names a LoRA you don't
  have and the file is sitting next to the map — which is where a trainer
  leaves it — the app offers to copy it into your LoRA folder. Matching
  is case- and extension-tolerant, so a map made on another machine still
  finds its LoRA here.
- **Varied references.** When a map ships CLIP embeddings, an example
  image that is a near-duplicate of one already retrieved is passed over
  for the next-best different one, so a generation isn't guided by the
  same picture four times.
- **Nothing missing is fatal.** A map with no images now loads and
  contributes its captions as text rather than being rejected; a map
  whose LoRA isn't installed still guides with its images; corrupt or
  mismatched embeddings are ignored instead of failing the load.

## v1.12.0 — 2026-08-10
- **RAG maps.** New "🧭 RAG map…" button in the first section loads a
  `.ragmap.json` produced alongside a trained LoRA (see RAGMAP.md for the
  format). At generation it retrieves the example images most relevant to
  your prompt and feeds them as IP-Adapter visual guidance, while
  auto-applying the paired LoRA and trigger word — so results stay
  faithful to what the LoRA was trained on. SDXL models only; offers a
  one-time IP-Adapter download, and falls back to caption text if it's
  not installed. The loaded map is remembered between sessions.

## v1.11.3 — 2026-08-09
- Simplified the editor checkbox label to just "Output at Canvas size".
- The Border maker now has its own **Variations (1-10)** control, so one
  prompt can auto-generate several borders (each a different seed) to
  pick the best from. Previously borders quietly used the main section's
  Variations value; now it's a dedicated, persisted setting in the
  Border section.

## v1.11.2 — 2026-08-09
- Removed the in-app LoRA training feature to keep the app simple and
  fully self-contained (it was the only feature that needed extra tools
  installed). "⭐ Add to training set" stays — it still builds a
  captioned dataset you can train with an external tool (see
  TRAINING.md).

## v1.11.1 — 2026-08-09
- Dropdowns now show their saved selection in readable text at all times.
  Previously most readonly dropdowns (aspect, size, keep, loop, motion,
  editor, presets, border model/style, video) rendered their value in a
  colour that vanished against the dark field, so they looked empty until
  clicked. Fixed the base combobox style to keep light text on the dark
  field in every state.

## v1.11.0 — 2026-08-09
Major feature release — six additions:
- **Hi-res upscaling.** New "Upscale 4x" toggle runs generations and
  borders through a RealESRGAN pass for print/4K-quality output
  (downloaded automatically by Setup / the update check).
- **In-app LoRA training.** "🎓 Train LoRA…" trains a style LoRA from your
  training set on your GPU, then installs it automatically. First use
  sets up the training toolkit (needs git + Python 3.10-3.12; one time).
- **Animator video + sprite sheets.** Export animations as MP4 or WebM
  (self-contained, no install needed) and/or a packed sprite-sheet PNG
  with a JSON atlas for game engines — alongside the existing GIF.
- **Batch queue.** ＋Q next to each Generate button adds the current
  settings as a job; "Run all" processes the whole batch unattended.
- **App self-updater.** On launch the app offers to download and install
  a newer release itself — no manual exe swapping.
- **Single-instance guard.** Warns if a second copy is opened and if a
  foreign engine already holds the port, preventing lost results.

## v1.10.5 — 2026-08-09
- The LoRA list now shows only the **current** border-frame LoRA;
  superseded versions (e.g. an older SDXL_BorderFrames_v#) are hidden so
  old attempts that didn't work don't clutter the list. Other LoRAs are
  unaffected.

## v1.10.4 — 2026-08-09
- **Auto-clean center (2nd pass).** When a theme puts a character or
  scene in the middle of a border, the app now automatically runs the
  frame through Flux Kontext to empty the center — keeping the ornate
  frame intact — then cuts the transparent center. This fixes the last
  failure mode (centered figures blocking the cutout). On by default;
  turns itself off with a note if Kontext isn't installed / won't fit
  VRAM, and falls back to the original frame if the pass fails. It only
  runs when the center is actually filled, so clean frames aren't slowed.

## v1.10.3 — 2026-08-08
- **Borders now float with a transparent margin** instead of running snug
  to the screen edge, matching the reference bezels.
- **Transparent center follows the frame's real inner silhouette**
  (octagon, arch, scalloped) — it keys the plain center by its own color
  instead of cutting a straight rectangle (falls back to a soft rectangle
  only when the center isn't cleanly empty).
- Lower border-LoRA strength and a stronger negative prompt reduce
  stray centered figures and gibberish text in the frame.
- Tip: use Variations 3–5 for borders and keep the best — some themes
  put content in the center or under-draw on a given seed.

## v1.10.2 — 2026-08-08
- **Much better borders.** The Border maker no longer forces generation
  into a flat rectangular edge band (which produced "a strip at the edge
  and a rectangle hole"). It now generates a complete ornate frame — like
  the reference set — and carves the center transparent along the frame's
  REAL inner silhouette, so ornaments that reach inward are preserved.
- Border prompt pushes intricate, varying-depth, corner-and-cartouche
  ornamentation; the negative prompt now fights scene-fill in the center.
- If a theme still bleeds into the middle, the center falls back to a
  clean rectangular cut so every border ends up with a usable
  transparent center.
- When the trained border LoRA is installed but your model is Flux (which
  can't use it), the Border maker auto-routes to Juggernaut-XL + the LoRA.

## v1.10.1 — 2026-08-08
- **Trained border LoRA (SDXL_BorderFrames_v1)** — a model trained on a
  curated bezel-frame collection that teaches the actual concept of a
  decorative frame (ornamental edges, corner medallions, themed
  cartouches) instead of drawing a full scene with a hole cut out. The
  Border maker auto-applies it on SDXL-family models (pick Juggernaut-XL
  for best results). Downloaded automatically by Setup / the update
  check.
- **➕ Add LoRA file…** button under the LoRA list: browse for any
  `.safetensors` LoRA and it's copied into your LoRA folder, ticked
  immediately, and loaded automatically on every restart. Plus a
  **📁 LoRA folder** shortcut to open the folder directly.
- Model downloads now support direct URLs, so custom-trained models can
  ship through the same Setup / update pipeline as the HuggingFace ones.

## v1.10.0 — 2026-08-08
- Border maker gets its own **Model** and **Style** dropdowns (defaults:
  "Same as main", no style) — pick a different model/style for borders
  without touching the main controls. Both persist across sessions.
- **✕ Cancel buttons** next to all three progress bars (main, animator,
  border) — stop a running generation at any time.
- **"Loading the model…" feedback**: the status line now says when the
  engine is loading a model into GPU memory, explaining the pause
  before the progress bar starts (this was the "nothing happens" wait).
- New first-run defaults: BW Manga + Graphic Novel + LineArt Manga
  LoRAs preselected, Wide canvas, Marvel House Style, "Output at canvas
  size" checked; the Editor now always starts on Flux Kontext.
- Groundwork for the trained border LoRA (SDXL_BorderFrames_v1): when
  installed, the Border maker auto-applies it on SDXL-family models
  with its trigger word for properly designed frames.

## v1.9.1 — 2026-08-08
- Fixes "NameError: make_collage is not defined" when generating a
  border with reference images — the reference-collage helper was lost
  in an earlier refactor and has been rebuilt (one ref letterboxes,
  several tile in a grid on the border canvas).
- Editor model downloads triggered from the Border maker or Animator
  now drive that section's own progress bar instead of the main
  Generate bar.

## v1.9.0 — 2026-08-07
- Animator preset actions: a new "Preset" dropdown above the Action box
  with 25 hand-tuned animation prompts in alphabetical order (Attacking,
  Blocking, Casting a spell, Celebrating, Climbing, Crouching, Dancing,
  Dodging, Dying, Falling, Flying, Idle, Jumping, Kicking, Laughing,
  Punching, Running, Shooting, Slashing, Sneaking, Stomping walk,
  Taunting, Walking, Walking (side view), Waving). Selecting one fills
  the Action box with a prompt written to produce strong, loopable
  full-body motion — edit it freely afterwards to tailor it to your
  character.

## v1.8.1 — 2026-08-07
- Fixes near-static animation loops from short prompts: the auto-cutter
  now only considers segments that actually contain motion (it could
  previously pick the quietest chunk of a weak clip). Terse actions like
  "walking" are automatically expanded into an explicit full-body cycle
  description, and the default duration is 3 seconds.

## v1.8.0 — 2026-08-07
- Live GPU memory meter top-right: green bar + "used / max MB" readout,
  refreshed every 3 seconds from the driver — watch VRAM fill as models
  load and free up when jobs end.
- Editor entries now show their VRAM requirement (e.g. "needs ~24 GB");
  editors beyond the card's memory are greyed out and can't be selected,
  with an explanation of exactly how much they need.
- Three-tier VRAM handling for models and editors: green = comfortable,
  RED = tight fit — it will load and run but slower (one-time warning
  explains it), grey = blocked. Close-to-the-limit cards can now use
  everything that physically loads.

## v1.7.7 — 2026-08-07
- Defringe corrected (v1.7.6's version could worsen the outline): the
  background color is now measured from the RAW frame's corners before
  cutting (sampling the cut frame read black transparent pixels and
  neutralized the un-blend), and the silhouette parameters returned to
  moderate (1 px tighten + halo-dust removal). Validated best-of-three
  on the walking character.

## v1.7.6 — 2026-08-07
- Loop menu finalized: Seamless auto-cut is the permanent default (fresh
  at every launch), with Ping-pong and Crossfade as per-run options. The
  in-place generated mode is removed from the menu — it froze
  walking-type actions. All remaining options are guarded against short
  clips and cannot break the pipeline.
- Validated: 4-second walks give the auto-cutter several stride cycles;
  loop seam measurably below general motion level (17.7 vs 22.7).
- Defringe made adaptive and more aggressive: the background color is
  sampled from each frame (the model repaints the stage, so it drifts),
  silhouettes erode 2 px, and faint halo pixels are dropped — removes
  the residual outline on transparent frames.

## v1.7.5 — 2026-08-07
- Clean edges on transparent animation frames: new defringe pass
  un-blends the known staging color out of semi-transparent edge pixels
  (removes the white/gray outline), then tightens and smooths the
  silhouette. Applied to every transparent animation frame and its GIF.

## v1.7.4 — 2026-08-07
- New default loop mode "Seamless motion (auto-cut)": the clip is
  generated with free, fluid motion, then automatically cut at its two
  most similar frames so it loops playing forward — walks and runs loop
  without ping-pong reversal. Longer durations (3–5 s) give tighter
  seams. "Seamless in-place (generated)" remains best for capes/idles.
- Auto-prep on every animation: the character is extracted from its
  background and staged on neutral gray before animating — fixes frozen
  or mushy motion from black backgrounds and hard cutouts.
- Seamless in-place quality: 30 steps / cfg 5.5.

## v1.7.3 — 2026-08-07
- Fixes near-static animations ("only the eyes blinked"): seamless mode
  anchors first and last frames to the same pose, and the model would
  take the laziest path. New **Motion** control (Subtle / Normal /
  Strong, default Strong) plus a rewritten motion-demanding prompt
  template. Measured ~10x more motion with the loop still closing
  cleanly.

## v1.7.2 — 2026-08-07
- Each section has its own progress bar + percent: the main bar serves
  only the main generation; the Animator and Border maker got dedicated
  bars under their generate buttons.
- Sections reordered: Animator above, Border maker at the very bottom.
- Bezel composer removed (superseded by the Image editor + border
  references); its code is deleted.

## v1.7.1 — 2026-08-07
- Progress everywhere, with percentages: Setup shows one overall bar +
  percent across the entire installation (runtime, packages, engine,
  every model byte); the app's generate bar shows percent and now also
  covers animations (which previously ran silently) and in-app model
  downloads.
- Clicking any Generate while a job runs now offers to cancel it —
  long animation jobs can no longer lock the app with no way out.
- "Make GIF" is now a checkbox in the Animator; generated GIFs land in
  the history, PLAY animated in the preview when selected, and Save As
  saves the .gif.
- New "Use selected" button in the Image editor: one click points the
  editor at the currently selected history image (label shows
  "selection"); greyed out while the history is empty.

## v1.7.0 — 2026-08-07
- True seamless loops: new "Seamless (generated loop)" mode — the
  animation is generated to start AND end on the character's exact pose
  (Wan 2.1 first-last-frame, ~18 GB, self-installs), so it loops playing
  forward. No ping-pong moonwalking, no crossfade. Now the default loop
  mode; ping-pong/crossfade remain as fast alternatives.
- Double-click a history thumbnail to load that image straight into the
  Animator's character slot.
- Model governance: a permanent audit test verifies every model file the
  app references is in the update manifest and resolves on HuggingFace —
  Setup always installs the latest of everything, and the startup check
  validates the full set (24 files, ~129 GB fully loaded).

## v1.6.0 — 2026-08-07
- ANIMATOR: animate a character image into sprite frames and a GIF
  (Wan 2.2, Apache 2.0, ~18 GB, self-installs). Pick a character (any
  image, or the current gallery selection), describe the action, choose
  duration (1–5 s), frames to keep (24/12/8/6 fps), loop mode
  (Ping-pong = perfect loop, Crossfade, or none), and canvas. Output:
  transparent PNG frames folder + looping GIF + optional zip — made for
  old-school animated sprites.
- Mouse wheel now scrolls the left panel from anywhere inside it.

## v1.5.3 — 2026-08-07
- Border maker defaults to widescreen 16:9 HD (1920x1080). Borders keep
  the exact-canvas-size logic from v1.5.2 (references condition the art,
  the selected aspect sets the output dimensions).

## v1.5.2 — 2026-08-07
- New "Output at canvas size" checkbox in the Image editor: the loaded
  image is used purely as reference while the output is generated at the
  canvas size selected in the settings — e.g. a portrait character can
  be re-staged into a widescreen scene. Off by default so in-place edits
  (like text removal) stay pixel-faithful to the original size.
- Borders from references now always output at the exact selected
  aspect/dimensions (no more resolution snapping).

## v1.5.1 — 2026-08-07
- Border maker simplified: the Style selector and the section's own
  Model/Variations controls are removed — borders now mimic the main
  generation settings (model, LoRAs, Variations, Steps, Seed, Editor).
  The section only sets border prompt, aspect, thickness and references.
- Full validation pass: main generation (3 model families), prompt-only
  masked borders, and border-from-reference via the editor all
  regression-tested.

## v1.5.0 — 2026-08-07
- Border references now use the image editor (same engines and logic as
  the Image Editor section): the reference is shaped to the border canvas
  and redrawn as the frame — style, characters and composition carry
  over. The old img2img seeding for border refs is removed, along with
  its influence slider. Prompt-only borders keep masked generation.

## v1.4.1 — 2026-08-07
- Setup now recalculates its numbers live from the model manifest: full
  model-pack size, how many GB are still to download on this machine, and
  the estimated total disk use when installation completes.
- Running the app before Setup now states plainly that it cannot create
  art until Setup completes the installation.

## v1.4.0 — 2026-08-07
- The reference feature is replaced by a true **image editor**
  (Gemini-style): load image(s) and the prompt is the instruction —
  change settings, remove words/titles, move characters to new scenes,
  increase details, combine images. Two engines: **Flux Kontext** (best
  overall) and **Qwen Image Edit** (best text removal, Apache 2.0),
  selectable in the editor row; models self-install on first use.
- Border-reference influence slider moved into the Border maker section.

## v1.3.4 — 2026-08-07
- "🗑 Delete image" button: permanently deletes the selected image from
  disk and the history strip (with confirm) — generate variations, keep
  only the one you want.

## v1.3.3 — 2026-08-07
- GPU compatibility check: the app detects your NVIDIA card's VRAM at
  startup. Models that fit show green in the model dropdowns; models
  beyond the card's memory are greyed out, labeled "exceeds GPU memory",
  and can't be selected or generated with (a clear warning explains why).
  Machines without an NVIDIA GPU get an explicit incompatibility notice.

## v1.3.2 — 2026-08-07
- Reference images simplified to a single override behavior (the three
  modes are gone): loading references makes them the source of art style,
  composition and characters — the prompt picks what to use from them,
  and the art-style preset + LoRA selections are automatically ignored
  while references are active. "Change amount" is now "Reference
  influence".
- Fixes "Prompt outputs failed validation (CheckpointLoaderSimple)": a
  stale engine left over from an old version could be running with wrong
  model paths. The app now detects an engine that can't see the model
  folder and restarts it with correct settings — automatically at
  startup, and with a prompt at generate time.

## v1.3.1 — 2026-08-07
- Fixes "HTTPError 400 … /prompt" for users who updated from older
  versions: the update popup could deliver the IP-Adapter models but not
  the engine node. The app now detects the missing add-on when a
  style/character reference is used and installs it itself (node +
  models + engine restart) after a yes/no prompt.
- Engine 400 responses now surface the real reason (invalid nodes,
  missing models) instead of a bare HTTP error.

## v1.3.0 — 2026-08-07
- Reference images now have three modes (fixes "the model just repeats
  the image"): **Redraw composition** (img2img, keeps layout — all
  models), **Copy the style** (paints new scenes in the reference's look),
  and **Use the character** (puts the reference's subject in whatever
  scene the prompt describes). Style/character modes use IP-Adapter and
  work with SDXL-family models.
- IP-Adapter node + models added to Setup and the update manifest;
  engine updates now preserve custom nodes.

## v1.2.3 — 2026-08-07
- First-run experience fix (blank model list on fresh PCs): the app now
  detects a missing engine or empty model folder, explains it plainly,
  and offers to launch Setup.exe directly. The status bar also says what
  to do when no models are found.

## v1.2.2 — 2026-08-07
- Portability fix for public release: the model-paths config is now
  written by the app with the machine's own absolute path at every engine
  start — the folder works wherever it is unzipped.
- First GitHub release.

## v1.2.1 — 2026-08-06
- Border maker takes a full multiline prompt (not just a theme), with a
  checkbox to either wrap it in the frame-structure wording (recommended)
  or use it 100% verbatim for maximum precision.

## v1.2.0 — 2026-08-06
- Bezel composer (🧩 button): composite character/art PNGs onto any
  border — position presets (side panels, corners, top/bottom), size,
  flip, nudge, optional screen-area clipping, preview, one-click save.
  In-app directions explain which borders and images to use.
- New model: Flux.1-schnell fp8 (Apache 2.0 — outputs fully unrestricted,
  including commercial use). 4-step sampling wired in automatically.
- Startup update check now also covers tools: the ComfyUI engine is
  checked against GitHub and offered in the same update popup as models;
  updating preserves user data, refreshes packages, restarts the engine.
- Multiple reference images for the main generation (several = collage),
  and the Border maker now takes reference images too — they guide the
  border art (influence via the Change amount slider) while the center
  stays empty.
- "⭐ Add to training set" button banks any result (image + prompt as
  caption) into training\dataset — the raw material for training your own
  style LoRA. See the new TRAINING.md for the full path from dataset to
  LoRA and how styles carry across model generations.

## v1.1.12 — 2026-08-06
- ROOT-CAUSE FIX for values vanishing from dropdowns (aspect ratio, model,
  LoRAs…): Tk's selection-export made a box's displayed value disappear
  whenever another box was clicked. All 12 input widgets now disable
  selection export — selections always stay visible, including after
  restart.
- Full code review pass; border variations no longer force random seeds
  (fixed seed + variations is reproducible again).

## v1.1.11 — 2026-08-06
- No selection is ever cleared by another choice: switching models only
  adapts the preset dropdown's option list; your current preset, border
  style, border model and aspect all stay exactly as you set them.
- Border model selector is fully independent of the main model selector.

## v1.1.10 — 2026-08-06
- Model is now selected first (moved above Art Style), and the preset
  dropdown only lists styles suited to the selected model's family.
- Selecting a preset no longer changes the model (the old auto-switch
  that reset the model selection is removed).

## v1.1.9 — 2026-08-06
- Border maker theming: style selector (Franchise for games/movies/comics,
  Arcade cabinet bezel, Material/concept), its own model selector, and
  its own Variations 1–10 to generate multiple borders per theme and pick
  the best.
- Borders now use masked generation — art can only be painted in the
  border zone, so the center stays empty no matter how busy the theme.
- Anti-text hardening baked into the border prompts (works even on Turbo
  models where negative prompts are weak).

## v1.1.8 — 2026-08-06
- Border maker moved from a popup into the bottom of the main control
  panel; its settings (theme, aspect, thickness) are remembered like
  everything else.
- The left control panel scrolls vertically (scrollbar + mouse wheel)
  when the window is too small to show all options.

## v1.1.7 — 2026-08-06
- Border maker: generate themed 4:3 / 16:9 (720p or 1080p) border frames
  with a fully transparent center — thickness slider 6–30%, hard-wired
  no-text negative prompt, uses the main window's model/LoRAs/variations.
  Saved as `border_*.png` with alpha.

## v1.1.6 — 2026-08-06
- Reference image (img2img): load any picture and the AI modifies /
  redraws / reinterprets it per your prompt and style preset. "Change
  amount" slider (10–95%) controls how far it strays from the original.
  Works with all models, variations, LoRAs and transparency; the
  reference's name and change amount are recorded in the PNG metadata.

## v1.1.5 — 2026-08-06
- "Batch" renamed to "Variations" and extended to 1–10: each variation
  runs the same prompt with a different seed.
- Clarified: the pipeline has no content filter or safety checker of any
  kind — generation limits come only from the chosen model's training.

## v1.1.4 — 2026-08-06
- "❌ Delete art files…" button under Clear history: permanently deletes
  all generated PNGs (output folder + engine scratch) after a red-text
  confirmation dialog showing file count and size.

## v1.1.3 — 2026-08-06
- Session gallery: horizontal scrollbar + mouse-wheel scrolling through
  thumbnails; newest result auto-scrolls into view.
- "Clear history" button at the bottom right empties the gallery strip
  (saved PNGs in `output\` are not touched).

## v1.1.2 — 2026-08-06
- LoRA selection redesigned: the three dropdowns are gone — one list where
  you tick any number of LoRAs (plus a single strength slider). This also
  eliminates the selection-eats-selection bug for good.
- Settings now auto-save on every change (debounced), not just on
  generate/close — verified to survive even a force-killed process.
- UI message loop hardened: an error while handling a result can no longer
  freeze the interface mid-generation.

## v1.1.1 — 2026-08-06
- Everything stays inside the app folder: pip cache disabled, Setup temp
  files moved in-folder, background-removal model and HuggingFace caches
  relocated to `models\` — nothing is written to the user profile or
  AppData.
- Setup always verifies models against their **latest releases** on
  HuggingFace (missing *and* outdated files are fetched), using the same
  check as the app — Setup and the app can no longer disagree, so no more
  surprise multi-GB prompts right after a completed setup.
- Setup grays out to "Installed" when everything is present and current,
  both on launch and after a successful run.
- `ComicArtCreator.exe` is now a single file in the main folder next to
  `Setup.exe` (no more `ComicArtCreator\` subfolder).
- LoRA fixes: the same LoRA can no longer be selected in two slots
  (it silently stacked twice); added a third LoRA slot.

## v1.1.0 — 2026-08-06
- Zero-prerequisite installs: Setup.exe now bootstraps a private embedded
  Python 3.12 runtime inside the app folder (`python\`) — target machines
  need nothing but 64-bit Windows 10/11 and an NVIDIA driver. Nothing is
  installed system-wide.
- App prefers the bundled runtime and falls back to a dev venv.
- `Setup.exe --cli [--skip-models]` headless mode (logs to setup.log).

## v1.0.2 — 2026-08-06
- Batch-file-free release: `Setup.exe` (graphical installer with progress
  log) replaces `setup.bat`/`setup.ps1`; the app launches from
  `ComicArtCreator.exe` only.
- Setup.exe no longer requires git — the engine is fetched as a zip.
- Both exes carry proper Windows version metadata; built for 64-bit
  Windows 10 and 11.

## v1.0.1 — 2026-08-06
- Version bump / packaging release (no functional changes from v1.0.0).

## v1.0.0 — 2026-08-06
Initial release.
- Tkinter studio app driving a headless ComfyUI engine (loopback only,
  auto-started, auto-spawned if not running).
- 4 starter checkpoints: Flux.1-dev fp8, Juggernaut XL v9,
  DreamShaper XL Turbo v2.1, Animagine XL 4.0 — sampler/steps/CFG
  auto-tuned per model family; model sizes + VRAM guidance shown in-app.
- 21 art style presets with editable style text, examples, and per-preset
  model hints.
- 7-LoRA starter pack (Flux_/SDXL_ prefixed) + 2 LoRA slots with strength
  sliders + CivitAI downloader (DPAPI-encrypted API key).
- Transparent-background generation (rembg isnet-general-use).
- Auto-save with full recipe embedded in PNG metadata; session gallery;
  Save As; seed control + reuse; batch up to 8.
- UI-state persistence across restarts; Clear button; user-typed negative
  prompts never overwritten by preset switching.
- Startup model-update check against HuggingFace with yes/no popup.
- Packaged exe (PyInstaller onedir), setup.ps1 for fresh machines.
- OWASP-mapped security review (SECURITY.md): safetensors-only policy,
  path-traversal-safe downloads, HTTPS-only, loopback engine.
